# Hi, I'm Fernando 👋

I build **reproducible scientific software** and computational tools, with emphasis on clear documentation, performance-aware code, and reliable workflows.

**Interests:** scientific computing • data analysis • HPC workflows • modeling & simulation  
**Tools:** Python • Julia • Git • Linux • Electronic Structure • Condensed Matter

## Featured work
- **Codes** — Compilation of various scientific codes in different coding languages.
- **Electronic Structure** — Examples of VASP and QuantumEspresso input files for material's properties
- **Tutorials** — A set of quantum electrodynamics and topological matter tutorials made in collaboration with my group
- **Quantum Dots** - Collaboration with an experimental group to investigate light adsorption shapes on Quantum Dots.
